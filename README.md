# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction System


## 📌 Overview

The **Diabetes Prediction System** is a machine learning–based application designed to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes using medical and demographic data. Early detection of diabetes is essential for preventing severe health complications, and this project demonstrates how data-driven techniques can support early risk assessment and decision-making.

## 🧠 Project Description

This system analyzes structured healthcare data containing features such as glucose level, blood pressure, insulin level, body mass index (BMI), age, and number of pregnancies. The dataset is preprocessed using data cleaning, normalization, and missing value handling techniques to improve model reliability and performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed using visualizations to understand feature distributions, correlations, and trends. These insights help optimize model selection and improve prediction accuracy.

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Models

The following supervised learning algorithms are implemented and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

Each model is trained on historical patient data and evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. The best-performing model is selected based on overall evaluation results.
